# Projects for my university course called "Web Applications"
## Separated in voluntary and mandatory lab

### Voluntary Lab
In this part of the course, we had to build an app that allowed users to look for destinations and make flight reservations. This labs were used to practice for the mandatory labs and used simple techniques and technologies.

### Mandatory Lab
For this part, we had to build a full website that managed the reservations of different facilities for a university. To do this, we used technologies such as express, node, JQuery, Bootstrap and many more.
